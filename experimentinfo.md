# Crowdsourced research info

When you install this extension you are asked to participate in a randomized experiment to support Mozilla’s research into YouTube's algorithmic controls. This document describes the experiment in more detail.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why don’t I see the “STOP RECOMMENDING” button?

The button is not available for playlist recommendations, it is only available for individual video recommendations.

If you opted in to participating in Mozilla’s research you may have been assigned to a control group for which the button is not available.  In this case, in order to support our research, we ask that you leave the extension installed for at least one month and continue to use YouTube as normal.

### I have pressed the “STOP RECOMMENDING” button but it does not seem to be changing my recommendations - why is this?

If you opted in to participating in Mozilla’s research, you may have been assigned to a control group for which the button is available but has no effect.  In this case, in order to support our research, we ask that you leave the extension installed for at least one month and continue to use YouTube as normal.

It is also possible that YouTube is not acting on the feedback signals sent by pressing our button. By continuing to contribute data to our research, you can help us measure this.

### What happens if I do not opt in to the experiment?

If you do not opt in to the experiment, the randomized assignment will not occur and no data will be sent to Mozilla. Pressing the "STOP RECOMMENDING" button will send a YouTube "dislike" message. For the purposes of extension code, you will be considered to be in the dislike-and-collection-opt-out experiment arm.

## Experiment Arms

If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned to one of these experiment arms. Please do not uninstall the extension if you end up in an arm you don't like, as this will impact our research.
