# Experiment Info

When you install this extension you will be asked to agree to participate in a randomized experiment to support research and advocacy into YouTube's algorithmic controls.  This document desctibes the experiment in more detail.

If you do not agree to take part in the experiment, the randomized assiognment will not occur and no data will be sent to Mozilla.  Pressing the "STOP RECOMMENDING" button will send a YouTube "dislike" message.  For the purposes of extension code, you will be considered to be in the `dislike-and-collection-opt-out` experiment arm.

## Experiment Arms

If you agree to participate, you will be randomly assigned to one of these experiment arms.  We ask you please not to uninstall the extension if you end up in an arm you don't like, as this will seriously damage the validity of our research.  If you can not commit to this, please do not agree to participate in the experiment.
